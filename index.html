        <p class="para">I've tons of hobbies. Drawing creative drawings and painting and my favourite ones. I also love to make new crafts.  Reading is what I usually prefer in my free time. From frictional fairytales to Knowledge filled encyclopedias. I love Maths and learning something new in maths is one of my interests too. I love performing experiments because they are more fun than what it sounds like and the best part, we learn something new by it. Last, but not least I enjoy coding as well! Learning something new and making progress make us better. Praticing what we learn is certainly important. After all, Practice make perfect!
